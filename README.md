# Finding k

I know what you're thinking. That's Nemo. This project is not about finding him. I wish it was. But its not. I just needed an excuse to put Nemo's picture.

Moving on...

In this project, we propose, justify and implement (in R) an algorithm to find k for k-means clustering.

  * Algorithm.pdf has the detailed explanation of how we find the best k.
  * finding.R has the R code of implementation.
